We show that a frustrated superradiant phase transition occurs when the ground-state superradiance of cavity fields due to local light-matter interactions cannot simultaneously minimize the positive photon hopping energies. We solve the Dicke trimer model on a triangle motif with both negative and positive hopping energies and show that the latter results in a sixfold degenerate ground-state manifold in which the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken. In the frustrated superradiant phase, we find that two sets of diverging time and fluctuation scales coexist, one governed by the mean-field critical exponent and another by a novel critical exponent. The latter is associated with the fluctuation in the difference of local order parameters and gives rise to site-dependent photon number critical exponents, which may serve as an experimental probe for the frustrated superradiant phase. We provide a qualitative explanation for the emergence of unconventional critical scalings and demonstrate that they are generic properties of the frustrated superradiant phase at the hand of a one-dimensional Dicke lattice with an odd number of sites.

We show that, by tuning the total flux threading the loop, the universality class of superradiant phase transition (SPT) changes from that of the mean-field fully-connected systems to one that features anomalous critical phenomena. The anomalous SPT exhibits a closing of the energy gap with different critical exponents on both sides of transition and a discontinuity of correlations and fluctuation despite it being a continuous phase transition. In the anomalous normal phase, we find that a non-mean-field critical exponent for the closing energy gap and non-divergent fluctuations and correlations appear, which we attribute to the asymmetric dispersion relation. Moreover, we show that the nearest neighborhood complex hopping induces effective long-range interactions for position quadratures of the cavity fields, whose competition leads to a series of first order phase transitions among superradiant phases with varying degrees of frustration. The resulting multicritical points also show anomalous features such as two coexisting critical scalings on both sides of the transition.
